🔠 The ability to override navigation options

🚧 The ability to determine the behavior when reaching the boundaries (🔁 Roll / 🔛 Clamp / ⤴️ Escape)

---
### Advanced </>

🔌 The package code is defined in the `EasyTab.Runtime` assembly (don't forget to [include](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html#reference-another-assembly) it in your assembly)

🔧 The ability to change all fields of the `EasyTab` component through the code

⚙️ The ability to customize global behavior using `EasyTabIntegration.Globally`

🌱️ The ability to create local instances of `EasyTabIntegration` and `EasyTabSolver`

🕹️ The ability to independently control navigation through the code

✨ The ability to define additional blocking conditions for the availability of objects [(by decorate default Driver)]((#integration-with-your-tools))

# Configuration
The package provides several configuration levels: `EasyTab` (component), `EasyTabIntegration`, `EasyTabSolver`

### Configuration via `EasyTab` component
Component configuration is a universal way to easily and quickly configure navigation, because for this you just need to add the component to the `GameObject` and set the necessary parameters using the inspector or code.

It is great in cases where you need to define behavior in a local area of your project (for example, on a specific prefab or window)

---
#### SelectableRecognition
You can ignore `Selectable` on the same `GameObject`.

#### BorderMode
You can determine what the solver should do in cases when the extreme children (first or last) are reached when traversing the `Transform` tree

![image](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/dav-sea/EasyTab/master/Media/et-border.png)

`Escape` (default):
 The solver will go beyond the boundaries of this `Transform` and search in neighboring `Transform`\`s

`Roll`: The solver will **NOT** go beyond the boundaries of this Transform, but simply start navigation from the first available child element (👉 the best solution for pop-ups and windows)

`Clamp`: The solver will NOT go beyond the boundaries of this Transform, but simply stop at the last selected

#### ChildrenExtracting
You can exclude all the children of this Transform from the tree

#### JumpingPolicy
Allows you to set the behavior of jumping to other elements during navigation.

> [!TIP]
>
>  The specified jumps will be used only when the definition of the next `Selectable` starts with this `GameObject` (that is, when it is specified as `EventSystem.current.currentSelectedGameObject`). When traversing the `Transform` tree, jumps will be ignored

`DontUseJumps`: Disables jumping

`UseOnlyJumps`:  When navigating from this `GameObject`, the specified jumps will be used to determine the next `Selectable`. But if the specified jumps are unavailable (for example, not interactable), then the transition to the next `Selectable` will not occur.

`UseJumpsOrHierarchy`: When navigating from this `GameObject`, the specified jumps will be used to determine the next `Selectable`. But if the specified jumps are unavailable (for example, not interactable), then the next `Selectable` will be searched by traversing the `Transform` tree relative to this `GameObject`.

`UseJumpsOrTheirNext`: When navigating from this `GameObject`, the specified jumps will be used to determine the next `Selectable`. But if the specified jumps are unavailable (for example, not interactable), then the process of finding for the next `Selectable` will be started again, but relative `GameObject` specified as a jump (if it is not destroyed).

#### NextJump & ReverseJump
Jumps to the next and previous `GameObject` to be used when navigating from this `GameObject`. (Jumps are used only when `JumpingPolicy` is not `DontUseJumps`)

#### NavigationLock
You can block navigation when this `GameObject` is current. This can be useful when you don't need navigation on this `GameObject`. In Auto mode, navigation is blocked automatically when this `GameObject` contains an `InputField` in the multiline and focused state

#### EnterHandling
You can determine whether navigation on this `GameObject` should occur when you press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. In auto mode, when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, navigation will occur if this `GameObject` contains an `InputField` in the single-line state

### Configuration via `EasyTabIntegration` class
`EasyTabIntegration` is a class that uses `InputSystem` and `EventSystem` to define the input and the currently selected object. As well as processing auxiliary functions, such as remembering the last selected object.

For ease of integration, one instance of class `EasyTabIntegration` is located in `EasyTabIntegration.Globally`. The update logic of this instance is embedded in `PlayerLoop`, and is always processed.    

If this does not suit you, you can disable the processing of the global object from `PlayerLoop` via `EasyTabIntegration.GloballyEnabled = false`

You can call the update logic yourself at the time you need via `EasyTabIntegration.Globally.UpdateAll()`. 

You can change the time to start fast navigation through the `SecondsForStartFastNavigation` field as well as the speed of fast navigation through the `SecondsBetweenSelectablesInFastNavigation` field

Or you can make your own instance of `EasyTabIntegration` and work with it, ignoring `EasyTabIntegration.Globally`

You can also configure `EasyTabIntegration.Solver` (see the following section)

### Configuration `EasyTabSolver`
`EasyTabSolver` is a class whose task is to decide which `Selectable` will be next. To configure it globally, use `EasyTabIntegration.Globally.Solver`

---
#### EntryPoint
The `GameObject` to be used as the initial one. Combined with the `FallbackNavigationPolicy` specified in the `WhenCurrentIsNotSet` and `WhenCurrentIsNotSelectable` fields

#### LastSelected
The last selected object. If this solver is specified in `EasyTabIntegration`, then this field is updated by it. Combined with the `FallbackNavigationPolicy` specified in the `WhenCurrentIsNotSet` and `WhenCurrentIsNotSelectable` fields

#### FallbackNavigationPolicy
You can set `NavigationPolicy` in different cases: `WhenCurrentIsNotSet`, `WhenCurrentIsNotSelectable`

`AllowNavigateToEntryPoint`: Allow navigation on `EntryPoint` as a fallback option

`AllowNavigateToClosest`: Allow to find the nearest `Selectable` (works only if the current `GameObject` is not null) as a fallback option

`AllowNavigateToLastSelected`: Allow navigation to the last selected object (especially useful when focus is lost when clicking into the void) as a fallback option

# Integration with your tools
The idea of EasyTab is that it works "out of the box" and does not require any configuration. However, if you use third-party tools and unusual approaches to hide user interface elements and windows, then navigation may not work as expected.

EasyTab needs to understand which objects are really active and which are hidden. To do this, EasyTab offers a simple **API based on decorators**.

In simple cases, you just need to describe in which cases the element is not Selectable, for example:

```csharp
var solver = EasyTabIntergation.Globally.Solver;

// we decorate the default driver with a handler that defines elements with a Graphic component and a transparent color as not selectable 
solver.Driver = solver.Driver
    .WithSelectableBlocking(t => t.TryGetComponent<Graphic>(out var graphic) && graphic.color.a <= 0);
```

A common practice when developing a user interface in Unity is to hide elements by changing transparency, moving outside the screen space, zooming out, etc.

However, EasyTab does not know about your specific implementation of hiding windows/popups, so you can use the API too, but to exclude the hierarchy of objects from navigation, for example:
```c#
var solver = EasyTabIntergation.Globally.Solver;

// we decorate the default driver with a handler that excludes from navigation all children of elements that have a disabled window.
solver.Driver = solver.Driver
    .WithTraversingChildrenBlocking(t => t.TryGetComponent(out Window window) && !window.IsActive);
```
---
You can decorate any IEasyTabDriver method.

For example, you can decorate `GetBorderMode` and change the BorderMode for all windows through the decorator, so as not to override the BorderMode through the EasyTab component

```c#
var solver = EasyTabIntergation.Globally.Solver;

solver.Driver = solver.Driver.DecorateBorderMode((@base, target) =>
{
    // We want to navigate all the elements inside the window cyclically
    if (target.IsTransform(out var targetTransform) && targetTransform.TryGetComponent<Window>(out _))
        return BorderMode.Roll;

    // If the target is not a window, then use the base decorator
    return @base.GetBorderMode(target);
});
```
